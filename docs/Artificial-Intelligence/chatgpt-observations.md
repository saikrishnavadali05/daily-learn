title: ChatGPT pratical observations

### May remove contents given in previous prompt
1. While building website, as you keep adding features via prompting, chatgpt may remove previous features to show new feature in tht chat.
2. You may have to manually integrate both (with intuition and prior knowledge / experience)
    - If error comes, paste the merged code and ask it to fix the entire code
    - Again feature may not work
    - Again prompt
    - Keep repeating step 2 till things work as expected
