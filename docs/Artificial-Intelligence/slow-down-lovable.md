title: Slow down While you use lovable (for early developers)
---

### Early developers should slow down while using lovable (or any AI tool in general)
1. We will not know what and how AI is writing in the code. very low control for developers
2. In case, If I start developing website using chatgpt, slowly, we will know what is getting changed, what is same, etc and we can track & reuse using git commits
3. Reusing components may become difficult (because you cannot track at every step using tool like git)

### Be aware of when to prompt for a full app, when to prompt step by step
1. When to prompt full, prompt a bit, etc
2. When to speed up, when to slow down
