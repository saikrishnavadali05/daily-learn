title: What is Yarn in Docusaurus
---
### ðŸ§¶ What is Yarn?

**Yarn** is a **package manager**, like **npm** (Node Package Manager). It helps you:

* Download and install **JavaScript dependencies** (like React, Docusaurus core libraries, etc.)
* Manage **versions** of packages
* Run project-related scripts (e.g., `start`, `build`, `deploy`)

### ðŸ“Œ Yarn in Docusaurus

When using **Docusaurus**, you can choose between:

| Package Manager | Command Examples             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **npm**         | `npm install`, `npm start`   |
| **yarn**        | `yarn install`, `yarn start` |

Docusaurus officially supports **both**, but many developers prefer **Yarn** because it is:

* **Faster** than npm (especially older versions of npm)
* Has **deterministic installs** using `yarn.lock` (ensures consistent versions)
* Better caching

### ðŸ’¡ When You See Yarn in Docusaurus Docs

If the documentation says:

```bash
yarn create docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

Itâ€™s using Yarn to:

1. **Create** a new Docusaurus project
2. Automatically **install** all required packages
3. Set up the basic structure

### ðŸ“¦ Summary

* **Yarn is just a tool** to manage packages in a Docusaurus project.
* It helps run commands like `start`, `build`, `deploy`, and manage dependencies.
* Docusaurus supports both `yarn` and `npm`. Choose one and stick to it per project.

Let me know if you want help switching from npm to yarn or want to explore `yarn.lock` vs `package-lock.json`.
