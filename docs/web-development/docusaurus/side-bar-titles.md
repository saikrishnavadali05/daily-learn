title: Fix to remove File Name as Headings

## docusaurus is showing file names as headings

If Docusaurus is showing **file names as headings**, it's likely because of how the markdown files are being interpreted in the sidebar or the markdown content itself. Here's how to fix it based on the situation:

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Situation 1: Sidebar shows file names instead of custom titles**

This usually happens when you're using `autogenerated` sidebar mode.

#### ‚úÖ Fix:

Use `title` in the frontmatter of your markdown files.

```md
---
title: My Custom Title
---
```

Also make sure your `sidebars.js` is set up like this:

```js
{
  type: 'autogenerated',
  dirName: 'docs', // replace with your directory
}
```

Docusaurus will now show `title` instead of the filename.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Situation 2: The first heading in the content is the file name**

This happens when you generate markdown from scripts or don‚Äôt set a proper `#` heading.

#### ‚úÖ Fix:

Open the `.md` file and ensure the top of the file looks like this:

```md
---
title: My Page Title
---

# My Page Title
```

Or you can remove the `#` heading if the layout already includes the `title` from frontmatter.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Situation 3: Sidebar `manual` config uses filenames**

If you're using a manual `sidebars.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  tutorialSidebar: [
    'intro', // shows as "Intro"
    'installing', // shows as "Installing"
  ],
};
```

Here Docusaurus infers titles from filenames or `title` frontmatter. To override:

```js
{
  type: 'doc',
  id: 'installing',
  label: 'How to Install',
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Recap Fixes

* Always use `title:` in frontmatter.
* Use `label:` in sidebars.js if manually specifying.
* Check that your markdown doesn't start with an unintentional heading derived from filenames.

---

If you're still seeing the filename despite setting a title, paste a sample markdown file and your `sidebars.js`, and I‚Äôll debug further.
